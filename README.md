# Moros1138MapFormat

Moros1138MapFormat is an extension for [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org) to provide a highly opinionated custom binary file format to ease the use of Tile Maps in C++ applications!

## Installation

When you want to add these extensions to your Tiled installation:

* Open Tiled and go to _Edit > Preferences > Plugins_ and click the "Open"
  button to open the extensions directory.

* [Download](https://github.com/Moros1138/Moros1138MapFormat/archive/master.zip)
  the files in this repository and extract them to that location. The scripts
  can be placed either directly in the extensions directory or in a
  subdirectory.

  (Alternatively, clone this git repository into the extensions directory)

* When using a version older than Tiled 1.3.3, restart Tiled.

  (This was necessary because Tiled only watched existing scripts for
  changes. No restarts are necessary when making changes to existing script
  files, since it will trigger an automatic reloading of the scripts.)
